# bot shows my server as offline but I know it isn't


 - can you connect to your Minecraft server from a Minecraft client? If not then your server must be offline or you might be having an issue with IPs/port forwarding 

 - try setting bedrock mode to true/on/yes some proxy servers can mess with the bot so that might be the issue 

 - make sure you have typed in the correct ip and port we currently don't support ipv6 at the moment 

 - is your server publicly accessible? Your server must be port forwarded and you must use a public ip not a private ip which can look like the following 192.168.xxx.xxx 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 127.xxx.xxx.xxx 172.xxx.xxx.xxx
