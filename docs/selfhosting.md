### installing required software

first make sure your packages are up to date

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

<br>

now we need to install git and redis server
```
sudo apt install git redis-server
```

<br>

then install mongodb the have some grate instruction on their website https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

<br>

finally we will install nodejs

```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
<br>
<br>

### downloading files

i recommend putting the files in /opt but you can put them where ever you want so change directory to your desired place.

```
cd /opt
```

clone the repository

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/404invalid-user/MC-status-bot.git
